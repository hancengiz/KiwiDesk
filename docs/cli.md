# CLI & IPC Reference

One binary is both the app and the CLI:

```sh
kiwidesk                      # run the window manager
kiwidesk <command> [args...]  # send a command to the app
kiwidesk help                 # local usage
kiwidesk --version            # local version (no app needed)
kiwidesk list_commands        # every command, grouped
kiwidesk help <name>          # one command's arguments
```

> The Homebrew cask puts it on your `PATH` as lower-case
> `kiwidesk`, which every example here uses. A source build
> produces `.build/release/KiwiDesk` instead — same commands, so
> substitute that path for `kiwidesk` throughout. The capitalized
> `KiwiDesk` elsewhere on this page is the Lua global, the config
> directory, or the product name.

**Installed from the `.dmg`?** The app bundle carries the same
executable; the cask only links it onto your `PATH`. Do that once
yourself:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -sf /Applications/KiwiDesk.app/Contents/MacOS/KiwiDesk \
  /usr/local/bin/kiwidesk
```

The `mkdir` is there because `/usr/local/bin` may not exist on a
Mac that has never had Homebrew. Link, never copy: a copy fails
its signature check.

A directory you own works without `sudo` as long as your shell
already searches it; `~/.local/bin` is **not** on the macOS
default `PATH`, so it needs adding first.

Commands are sent over a UNIX domain socket at
`~/.config/KiwiDesk/KiwiDesk.sock`. Exit code is 0 on success, 1
on error; data goes to stdout, the error message — and, on some
successes, a note — to stderr.

Data on stdout is JSON with its object keys **sorted**, indented
when stdout is a terminal and compact — one line — when it is
piped or redirected. `subscribe` is unaffected either way: its
stream is newline-delimited JSON, one event per line, whatever
stdout is.

## Version

```sh
kiwidesk --version   # or -v; works without the app running
```

Prints `<semantic version> (<short commit>)`, e.g. `0.1.0
(abc1234)`, or just the semantic version when the commit is
unknown: only a release build knows its commit, so a build you
make yourself prints the bare version. The same information is
available over IPC/Lua as the `version` command — see the table
below.

## Discovering Commands

```sh
kiwidesk list_commands              # every command, grouped
kiwidesk help scroll.set_anchor     # one command in full
kiwidesk list_commands --json       # the same, machine-readable
```

Both work **without the app running**: the listing describes the
API the binary was built with, carries no app state, and asks
nothing over the socket.

`list_commands` prints one block per group: the `KiwiDesk` table
first (the commands a keybinding usually names), then each layout
and bar namespace. Every line carries the command's arguments and
a one-line summary:

```
scroll
  set_anchor <anchor>                Sets where the focused …
  set_orientation <orientation>      Sets whether columns scroll …
  set_slot_size_override <space> <size>   Overrides the slot …
```

Required arguments are in `<angle brackets>`, optional ones in
`[square brackets]`. A command the CLI cannot reach is marked:
`(lua only)` for the entry points that live on the Lua table
alone (`bind`, `on`, `exec`, …), `(cli only)` for `subscribe`.

Naming one command prints its full signature, including the legal
values of an enum argument and the Swift type they come from:

```
$ kiwidesk help scroll.set_anchor
scroll.set_anchor <anchor>

  Sets where the focused window comes to rest in the viewport.

arguments:
  anchor        choice
                  center | start | end | follow
                  (ScrollingParams.Anchor)

  lua: scroll.set_anchor(anchor)
  cli: kiwidesk scroll.set_anchor <anchor>
```

Those values are **read from the decoder that accepts them**, so
the listing cannot fall behind the code.

A misspelled name fails with a suggestion and exit code 1:

```
$ kiwidesk help focsu
error: unknown command: focsu (did you mean focus?)
```

Unlike the did-you-mean hint on an unknown *command*, this one
will point at a Lua-only name.

**Text or JSON.** A terminal gets the text above; a pipe or a
redirect gets JSON. `--json` forces JSON either way. An
unrecognised option is an error, not a silent no-op.

`list_commands` returns `{"commands": <count>, "groups": [...]}`,
each group carrying one object per command — `name`,
`qualified_name`, `group`, `command`, `channel`, `summary`,
`aliases`, and an `arguments` array whose enum entries add
`values`.

The Swift type an enum's values were read from is **not** a JSON
field; it appears in the terminal rendering only. `values` is
what answers "what may I send".

Bare `kiwidesk help` (and `--help` / `-h`) still prints the short
usage block. Add a name, or `--json`, to get the API instead.

## Service Control

```sh
kiwidesk service start     # LaunchAgent: run at login,
                           # restart after crashes
kiwidesk service stop
kiwidesk service restart
kiwidesk service status    # loaded? running? pid?
```

`start` bootstraps the agent when it isn't loaded, and
**relaunches it when the job is loaded but idle** — the state a
quick-menu Quit leaves behind. It no-ops with `KiwiDesk service
is already running` only when a process is actually running. `stop` prints
`KiwiDesk service is not running` cleanly when nothing is
loaded. `restart` boots the job out and back in; when nothing
was loaded it reports `KiwiDesk service was not running —
started it`. `status` reports the loaded/running state and the
pid. A real `launchctl` failure exits non-zero; the ordinary
already-running / not-running cases exit 0. `start` while
KiwiDesk is already running loads the agent, whose `RunAtLoad`
spawns one supervised launch; it finds the instance lock held,
brings the running copy forward once — taking focus from your
terminal — and exits cleanly.

**This service is the only way to get crash supervision** (#1071),
and Settings offers no switch for it. Settings ▸ General's
**Start at login** is the `SMAppService` login item (visible in
System Settings ▸ Login Items) and nothing else — it never
touches this agent, and this agent never touches it.

Both launch at login. The single-instance lock keeps that to one
process, but only the launch that *wins* is supervised, so
running both makes supervision a coin flip (see
[Accepted limitations](accepted-limitations.md)). Run one: this
service if you want crash restart, the login item if you do not.
While the service is loaded, the Settings switch shows as on and
inert, saying so. `service status` adds a `login item:` line
reporting the login-item state, and `service start` prints a note
when the login item is *also* on, saying that two mechanisms will
start KiwiDesk and to run one. These strings are the login item's
only appearance in CLI output.

## Exporting the Log

KiwiDesk writes its diagnostic lines to the macOS unified log
under its own subsystem, at default level and with the text
public, so the shipped app's log is readable on any Mac with no
debug build and no extra permission. To attach it to a bug
report, export the last stretch to a file:

```sh
/usr/bin/log show --last 15m \
  --predicate 'subsystem == "com.kiwicanopy.kiwidesk"' \
  --style compact > ~/Desktop/kiwidesk-log.txt
```

Reach back to just before the problem happened — `--last 15m`,
`--last 2h`, or `--start "2026-09-02 09:40:00"` for an exact
window — and attach the whole file to the issue. Spell out
`/usr/bin/log`: a shell alias named `log` is common. To watch
live while reproducing:

```sh
/usr/bin/log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.kiwicanopy.kiwidesk"' --style compact
```

`kiwidesk debug_log [message]` writes a marker line into this
same log — one before and one after a repro brackets it; it
exports nothing.

## Commands

:::unreleased
### Display navigation

| Command | Arguments | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `focus_display` | display selector | Focus the Space that screen already shows |
| `move_to_display` | display selector | Send the focused window to that screen's shown Space; keep focus here |
| `move_to_display_and_follow` | display selector | Move to that screen's shown Space and follow the window |

Selectors accept the 1-based `list_monitors` index, fingerprint,
exact name, `next`, `prev`, `left`, `right`, `up` or `down`.
Explicit identities win over relative words. Cycles wrap, including
on one display. Spatial moves use display centers, including diagonal
neighbors; [the Lua reference](lua-reference.md#focus_display)
defines ranking and tie-breaking. A missing neighbor or a display
with no Space refuses without creating or switching Spaces.

`move_space_to_display` also accepts these relative selectors.
`pin_space_to_display` still requires an explicit identity.
Window moves refuse native-fullscreen windows and retain the
[`move_to_space` sticky restrictions](lua-reference.md#move_to_space).

`list_monitors` returns positional order, each row carrying
`index`, `id`, `name`, `fingerprint`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`,
`active_space` (shown Space id or `null`) and `active` (boolean).
Geometry is in AppKit global points, with positive y upward.
`get_state` adds `active_display`, and each object in `spaces`
adds `display`: raw numeric display ids or `null`, joined to
`list_monitors`'s `id`, not its positional `index`.

```sh
kiwidesk focus_display left
kiwidesk move_to_display 2
kiwidesk move_to_display_and_follow next
kiwidesk move_space_to_display scratch right
```

:::unreleased
`set_float_placement` replaces `set_float_nudge`: a saved setting
that had the nudge off becomes `keep`, and a call to
`set_float_nudge` fails naming its replacement.
:::

`bind_profile_to_desktop` files one profile per screen count on a
Desktop, for all screen setups: a second profile of another count
adds beside the first, the same count replaces it.

Screen fingerprints after the profile, as `list_monitors` prints
them, scope the binding to that one screen setup ([Lua
reference](lua-reference.md#bind_profile_to_desktop)).

¹ placement: `first\|last\|before_focused\|after_focused`

`reset_layout_sizing` clears what `resize` accumulated on the
active space — or the space named, or every space for `all` —
the session layer and the stack and track weights — so it
lands on what its profile authored (an override's size field
stays; the global only where nothing was authored), and leaves
structure alone
([Lua reference](lua-reference.md#reset_layout_sizing)).

Every layout global has a per-space `_override` twin (e.g.
`bsp.set_ratio_h_override`, `scroll.set_slot_size_override`) that
takes a leading `space id, value` and shadows the global for that
space only.

`resize` adapts to the active layout and is per-axis (#56). A
floating focused window resizes itself directly in any mode
(width for `x`, height for `y`, floored at `min_window_size`),
splitting the delta between both edges and pinning one that is
already against the screen edge or a bar (#1091). "Floating" is
the effective float (#1184): the window's own flag, or any window
in a floating-layout space, which places nothing. A focused
window in native full screen is refused ahead of every layout,
whatever its float state, with `the focused window is
fullscreen` (#1298): nothing is written and no neighbour moves;
the pill and sound rule below apply to it as to the monocle/grid
reply.
For tiled windows: in BSP, `x` moves the side-by-side split
ratio and `y` the stacked one, independently, each in the
direction that grows the *focused* window's region (#122). In
stack (#67, #222), the split axis (`x` for a left/right stack
zone, `y` for top/bottom) moves the master/stack split in the
direction that grows the *focused* window; the focused zone's
own axis grows that window's share of its zone (session-scoped
weights, reset on relaunch). An axis matching neither fails with
the cue, so a master zone lined up *along* the split axis has no
reachable per-window shares (accepted — see
[design decisions](design-decisions.md)). Scrolling resizes the
slot along its own scroll axis for either `x` or `y`. In a track
space the axis across the tracks resizes the focused window's
track, the axis along them its share within the track (#128;
session-scoped weights too). Monocle and grid reply "not
supported" — that failure flashes a pill on the focused window
whatever issued it, and adds the system alert sound when
`set_refusal_sound` is on (default off) and a hotkey was what
fired: a CLI or IPC caller reads the error reply and never hears
one.

### Deleting a Space

`delete_space` succeeds whether or not the removal lasts.

When the space is still declared somewhere, the response says
where:

```json
{"status": "success",
 "data": {"declared_in": ["profile:Work", "init.lua"]}}
```

`declared_in` names every source that re-creates the space on the
next config load — what each means is under
[`delete_space`](lua-reference.md#delete_space) — and is absent
when none does. The JSON goes to stdout as always; the CLI adds
one line per source on stderr, so stdout carries nothing new:

```
removed from the live layout but still in saved profile "Work" — save the profile to make this durable
still composed by the built-in "Developer" standard — save a profile to make this durable
still created by init.lua — remove the call that creates it
```

### Applying Ignore Rules

`ignore_rules` is declarative config, not a session command. Edit
`ignore_rules = { "bundle.id" }` in `init.lua`, then
apply it with:

```sh
kiwidesk reload_config
```

For GUI-managed setups, put the array at the root `ignore_rules`
key in `gui.json` and reload the same way. Matching apps
disappear from KiwiDesk state and emit no window events. Removing
an id and reloading makes its windows manageable again.

Those declarations are the global base. A profile JSON may carry a
sparse `ignore_rules` object: `true` adds an id and `null` removes an
inherited one while that profile is active. `load_profile` applies the
resolved rules immediately over either a Lua- or GUI-owned base.

## Event Stream

External tools subscribe over the same socket:

```sh
kiwidesk subscribe                          # all events
kiwidesk subscribe space_change layout_change
```

Each event is one JSON line:

```json
{"event": "space_change",
 "data": {"space_id": "3", "layout_mode": "bsp",
          "window_count": 4}}
```

Events: `space_change`, `layout_change`, `focus_change`,
`monitor_change`, `desktop_change`, `window_created`,
`window_destroyed`, `window_moved_to_space`, `layer_change`.

Give no arguments and you get every event; give arguments and
the filter is honoured exactly. An argument that names no event
is dropped, and the subscription still succeeds — so the
confirmation line lists what was dropped:

```json
{"status": "success", "data": {"unknown": ["space_chnage"]}}
```

A non-string argument is dropped the same way and appears there
as `<non-string>`. The same names, truncated after the first few,
go to the application log (viewable in Console.app).

Subscribe to nothing *but* unrecognised names and the stream
stays silent: an empty filter is not the same request as no
filter.

Every window event carries `bundle_id` — the stable identity
key (the one app rules and `pull_or_spawn` match on) — next to
the locale-dependent display `app` name. It is JSON `null` for
unbundled processes; the Lua callback receives it as the
trailing positional argument, `""` when unknown.

`focus_change` data carries `window_id`, `app`, `bundle_id`,
**and** `title` — but the Lua callback receives only
`window_id, app, bundle_id` positionally, so the window title
is available on the socket stream but not to a Lua handler:

```json
{"event": "focus_change",
 "data": {"window_id": 4711, "app": "Ghostty",
          "bundle_id": "com.mitchellh.ghostty",
          "title": "~/src — zsh"}}
```

The window lifecycle events fire even when focus does not
change:

```json
{"event": "window_created",
 "data": {"window_id": 4711, "app": "Ghostty",
          "space_id": "2", "reason": "new",
          "bundle_id": "com.mitchellh.ghostty"}}
{"event": "window_destroyed",
 "data": {"window_id": 4711, "app": "Ghostty",
          "space_id": "2", "reason": "closed",
          "bundle_id": "com.mitchellh.ghostty",
          "desktop": null}}
```

`window_created` carries the space the window was placed in
(`app_rules` included); `window_destroyed` carries the space
the window disappeared from — its own space, even when that
space is not active.

These events track the *visible window set*, not app
lifecycle; the `reason` field says why the set changed:

- `window_created` — `new` (a genuinely new window),
  `returned` (back from another macOS Desktop, from an app
  that was unhidden, or from a session restore), `restored`
  (deminiaturized).
- `window_destroyed` — `closed` (a real close), `minimized`
  (only minimized; it will come back as `restored`),
  `hidden` (its app was hidden, with ⌘H or by hiding itself
  as its last window closed; the window is untouched and
  comes back as `returned`), `vanished` (the window is on a
  macOS Desktop no screen is showing; it returns as
  `returned`). A `vanished` payload also carries `desktop`,
  the Mission Control number of the Desktop holding the
  window, where the Desktop can be read; every other reason —
  and a Mac without SkyLight — sends `null`.

A window re-shown after a `closed` destroy — an app whose close
hides the window and shows the same one again — comes back as
`new` and is placed like one; `returned` is a Desktop return, an
unhide or a session restore.

A macOS Desktop switch thus fires a burst of `vanished`
destroys and a burst of `returned` creates — filter on
`reason` to ignore them. The reason is read off the
WindowServer: a window it still hosts on an unshown Desktop is
`vanished`, one it hosts nowhere is `closed`, whenever the
destroy lands. A window closed *while its Desktop is off-screen*
is reported `closed` when KiwiDesk next reads the Desktops — at
the next Desktop switch, or within about five seconds while any
window is away — so a consumer sees two destroys for that
window, `vanished` then `closed`, and refreshing on
`desktop_change` remains the safe pattern.

`window_moved_to_space` fires when a window is explicitly
moved to another space (`move_to_space`,
with or without follow, or a drag onto another display — the
live crossing emits as the membership moves, so a drag pulled
back before release emits once per crossing). A
`move_to_desktop` onto a Desktop that lives on **another
screen** emits it too: the window joins the space that screen
shows
([#1010](https://github.com/KiwiCanopy/KiwiDesk/issues/1010)).
`move_to_desktop` with a **named Space** emits it as well when
that Desktop is the one its screen is already showing —
`to_space_id` is the Space you named. When the Desktop is hidden
there is no `window_moved_to_space` at all: the window is
reported `vanished` and comes back with `window_created`,
`reason: returned`, already in the named Space
([#1150](https://github.com/KiwiCanopy/KiwiDesk/issues/1150)).
Bulk reassignments (profile load, session restore) stay silent:

```json
{"event": "window_moved_to_space",
 "data": {"window_id": 4711, "app": "Spotify",
          "from_space_id": "1", "to_space_id": "3",
          "bundle_id": "com.spotify.client"}}
```

`desktop_change` fires when the visible Desktop changes on any
screen — a swipe, Mission Control, or a `focus_desktop` /
`move_to_desktop_and_follow` command; its data carries the 1-based
Desktop number now current on the screen that switched, that
screen's positional number (`monitor`: 1 is the main screen,
secondaries follow left to right — the same 1-based positional
numbering a display argument takes), and the active profile:

```json
{"event": "desktop_change",
 "data": {"desktop": 2, "monitor": 1,
          "profile": "Creator Studio"}}
```

With "Displays have separate Spaces" on, each screen switches
Desktops on its own, so watch `monitor` to tell them apart:
only a switch on the main screen (`monitor: 1`) selects a
profile. A secondary screen's swipe reports its Desktop and
moves that screen onto the Space its arriving Desktop should
show — which emits `space_change` too when that screen is the
one holding the active Space. With the
option off, or with a single screen, `monitor` is always 1.

`layer_change` fires when the active keyboard layer changes —
a `switch_layer` call, a config reload returning you to
`default`, a profile switch — and never when a switch names the
layer already active. It carries the previous and the new layer
names, `default` included:

```json
{"event": "layer_change",
 "data": {"from_layer": "default", "to_layer": "resize"}}
```

## Raw IPC Protocol

Anything that can write to a UNIX socket can drive KiwiDesk —
newline-delimited JSON, one request per line:

```sh
printf '{"command":"set_mode","args":["1","grid"]}\n' \
    | nc -U ~/.config/KiwiDesk/KiwiDesk.sock
```

Response:

```json
{"status": "success"}
{"status": "error", "error": "unknown command: ..."}
```

Unknown commands come back with a did-you-mean suggestion when
a close match exists.
