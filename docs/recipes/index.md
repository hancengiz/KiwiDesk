# Recipes

Real-world integration patterns for KiwiDesk. All recipes use
either Lua event callbacks or the CLI event stream — no plugins
required.

## Integration approaches

**Lua hooks** (in `init.lua`): Subscribe to events within the
KiwiDesk Lua VM and trigger side effects directly. This is the
fastest path: no subprocess overhead, stateless, fire-and-forget.
Use this for tools that accept external command invocation
(sketchybar `--trigger`, borders `active_color=...`).

**CLI event stream** (shell scripts, other processes): Use
`kiwidesk subscribe <events...>` to receive newline-delimited
JSON from a separate terminal session or script. Query state
on-demand with `kiwidesk get_state` and `kiwidesk list_monitors`.
Use this when you need durable polling, cross-process
communication, or your tool runs in a different sandbox (like
Hammerspoon).

## External commands (KiwiDesk.exec)

Commands run asynchronously in the background and never block
window management. They append `/opt/homebrew/bin` and
`/usr/local/bin` to the child's PATH so Homebrew tools resolve.
See the [Lua reference](../lua-reference.md) for the full
`KiwiDesk.exec` and `os.execute` API, including callback,
timeout, and output capture.

> **Binary path note:** installed through the Homebrew cask,
> KiwiDesk is on your PATH as plain `kiwidesk` — use that
> directly. If you built from source instead, it is not on PATH:
> use the absolute path to your built binary (e.g.,
> `~/path/to/KiwiDesk/.build/release/KiwiDesk`) or symlink it
> yourself. The recipes below keep the path in a variable like
> `KIWIDESK=kiwidesk` so either setup works.
