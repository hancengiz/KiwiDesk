    /// each measures from: every path the retile serves writes a
    /// stored ratio, weight or length and re-derives geometry
    /// from it (`calculatedFrames` is a pure recomputation), so
    /// an instant write leaves the next glide frame's base exact,

    /// instant write creates no target to measure from. The
    /// hold-scoped record (`GlideCommandedBase`) is that missing
    /// base, and the argument for its lifetime is there.
    ///
    /// A held chord glides under Reduce Motion too (owner
    /// ruling, same date): a held-key resize is the keyboard's
    /// direct manipulation, which Reduce Motion does not suppress
    /// for the mouse either, and since these writes are instant
    /// for everyone no glide needs a second mechanism. An earlier
    /// version of this comment claimed that was already the whole
    /// answer, which was false while the floating path still
    /// re-based on `AnimationEngine.targetFrame` — with Reduce
    /// Motion on, animations off, or the engine disabled there
    /// was no target and it fell back to the echo-fed frame,
    /// losing 71% of a held resize (measured, #1090). It is true
